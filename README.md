# machine_maintainance

 ### Deployed on render click (https://machine-maintainance-fastapi-8eut.onrender.com/docs)

## **Project Overview**  
This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict the probability of machine failure based on sensor readings. By enabling proactive maintenance, this solution helps reduce operational costs and prevents unexpected downtime.  

## **Key Features**  
- Data preprocessing: Duplicate removal, class balancing, and feature selection.  
- Predictive modeling: Built a Random Forest model with 97% accuracy.  
- Validation: Applied cross-validation to ensure model robustness.  

## **Technologies Used**  
- **Programming:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib  

## **Project Structure**  
- `data/`: Contains the dataset (or instructions to download it).  
- `src/`: Includes the main script for building and evaluating the model.  
- `notebooks/`: Optional folder for a notebook version of the analysis.  
- `README.md`: Overview and documentation of the project.  
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies.  

## **Setup Instructions**  
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/predictive-maintenance.git
   cd predictive-maintenance

2.Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

3.Run the script:
python src/machine_maintenance_pred.py

## Results
The model achieved 97% accuracy in predicting machine failures, validated through cross-validation techniques.
